In this challenge we learn to use the redirect command or the `>` command. We store `PWN` in the `COLLEGE` file by using `PWN > COLLEGE` and unlock the flag.
```
Connected!
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{gc9PMHEJ8PCdq1148AjFaBlK94I.dRjN1QDL2ETO0czW}
