In this challenge we learn about navigating directories. We can navigate directories but using the `cd` (change direcrtory) command. This changes the current working directory.
In this challenge we run `/challenge/run` from a specific directory. For me this directory was `/sys/kernel` directory. 
```
Connected!
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /sys/kernel directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /sys/kernel
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/sys/kernel$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
