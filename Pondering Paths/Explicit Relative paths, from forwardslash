In this challenge, we learn that `./` is equal to a relative path. In operating systems like Linux, `.` refers to the same directory. 
We enter directory `/` and run the relative path `./challenge/run`.
```
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
