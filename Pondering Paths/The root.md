This challenge teaches us what a root `/` is. A filesystem starts at the root and then it's followed by directories, cofiguration files and programs. 
You can invoke a program by providing its path on the command line. Using an exact path (one that follows root directory) is called and "absolute path". 
In this challenge, we invoke `pwn` program using its absolute path to capture the flag.
